This is a project we done in MIT summer school in 2020, provided and supervised by Prof.Hui Chen.
'A mortgage lending model based on Logistic Regression.'
The dataset is provided. Please See "dataset" for more details.
This dataset contains his- torical information on a large number of single-family 30-year fixed rate mortgages. The dataset includes various loan and borrower characteristics. Some macro variables at state or MSA level are also included, which can be matched to each loan. See “Description.pdf” for details of the datasets and variables.

In this project, we aim to design a data-driven lending model, which automatically decides when to approve or reject a mortgage application.
For the purpose of maximizing the expected profit from its business, we use logictic regression model that uses the information available at the time of loan origination to predict whether a loan will become delinquent within the next 3 years.
See "Final Project.ipynb".

We just set different threshold value like 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 to get the confusion matrix and the final profit value.
You should mentally set the threshold value if you want a more compelling result.

Thanks a lot for our team members: Binghan Jiang, Peidong Han and Chang Wang.
